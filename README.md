# My Portfolio

I created [this Portfolio website](https://akil-sidratulmuntaha.github.io/myportfolio/) using [Minimal Theme](https://orderedlist.com/minimal/).

This is the raw HTML and styles that are used for the *minimal* theme on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Syntax highlighting is provided on GitHub Pages by [Pygments](http://pygments.org).

Beside index.html, I also made little change by modifying the styles.css file to make my portfolio website the way I want it to be.
